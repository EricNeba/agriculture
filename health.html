					<h3>HEALTH PROGRAMS</h3>
					<h4>Vital Signs Program</h4>
						<p>Agriculture has been one of the first programs since the creation of VSC-Cameroon. The education of farmers on modern methods of agriculture and animal husbandry has been the principal focus of this program. VSC-Cameroon have partnered with agricultural experts to educate farmers on the cultivation of cassava and plantains as a quick source of income generation for farmers. The introduction of the PAF method for nursing plantain suckers has boosted the quality and quantity of plantain production in Cameroon</p>
						<p>The health system in most Sub-Saharan countries is remotely and manually monitored. The non-computerization of health records is still a big problem in the health sector. The lack of professional ethics had caused a lot of Privacy issues in past attempts. The lack of appropriate technology and the location of some of these communities in rural areas is a course for concern.</p>
					<h4>Healthy Mother Healthy Babies Program</h4>
						<p>Infant mortality is still very high in most rural communities in Cameroon. The causes could span from malturition, inadequate medical equipment and infrastructure, inadequate education etc</p>		 
						<p>Teenage pregnancy is rampant as most communities encourage early marriages. Poverty is the order of the day in most of these communities.The lack of basic needs such as cloths, diapers, soap, traditional practices and nutritive food for babies are some of the contributing factors for infant mortality</p>
 
						<p>VSC-Cameroon comes in by providing first months needs for mothers and babies. We partner with community health centres and provide the basic necessities to families in need during the first months after child birth. Basically, we provide cloths, food, medication, diapers etc depending on the needs of the families. This program is done on referral bases and accessment takes place to see who qualifies</p>
