					<h3>RESEARCH</h3>
					<h4>Gender-based Violence</h4>
					<p>GBV is a world-wide issue that does not only affect women and girls, it affects men as well. In most developing countries all over the world, women and girls are most affected by GBV because they are more valuable than their male counterparts with cultural and political biases having a big role to play. These inequalities make it more difficult for women and girls to get an education, marry when they choose to, have little decision-making power over their lives, households and communities and limited access to legal protection. It’s not easy for women to access economic opportunities and even when they do, they often don’t have control over how their income is used.</p>
					<h4>CED and Poverty Reduction</h4>
					<p>CED is a relatively new concept in development and its role in poverty reduction is still being explored but there has been a relative success in the application of this theory in some communities in the West (Tamarak). CED could be referred to as a community-centered process   aimed at creating local economic opportunities that will improve social conditions, particularly for those who are most disadvantaged. The basic principle is about making or saving money through local and community led initiatives.</p>
